# HullQ — Current Project State

<!-- PROJECT_STATE_ACCEPTED_SLICE: 0060 -->
<!-- PROJECT_STATE_QUEUE_SLICE: 0061 -->

**Updated:** 2026-09-20  
**Latest owner-accepted / DONE slice:** SLICE-0060  
**Current queue:** SLICE-0061 — **Authenticated Professional Listing Draft Workspace**; post-SLICE-0060 repository/product reassessment and readiness are prepared on the existing Broker Workspace authorization/MFA, current membership-role, publication-eligibility and private-draft boundaries. Implementation remains unauthorized until independent exact-head readiness review/CI and readiness merge to `main`.  
**Exceptional historical state:** SLICE-0039 remains terminal `BLOCKED` and is not to be reopened.

This is the compact current-state entry point for HullQ. Historical implementation/review detail belongs in slice contracts, acceptance closures, retained research packages and Git history. Normative specs and accepted decisions remain authoritative where they apply.

## Product direction

HullQ is a native **broker-first mixed-supply** sailboat listing and technical-discovery marketplace:

```text
professional broker/dealer inventory
+
bounded owner-direct/private seller inventory
```

Private sellers may self-list directly or later voluntarily choose a broker-referral path. Neither route may be forced as a substitute for the other. Organic Search eligibility, match classification and ordering remain commercially independent; payment may buy a verification service but never truth, Search eligibility or organic position.

Primary buyer loop remains:

```text
technical requirements
→ deterministic BoatDesign/configuration evaluation
→ native marketplace inventory
→ physical-boat/listing truth
→ save / monitor / alert
→ seller/broker contact / qualified lead
```

Direct technical Search remains the primary low-friction buyer entry point. The post-0054 accepted guided Buyer Requirements path is optional and must reuse the same deterministic Search/evaluation semantics.

## Accepted provider surfaces

Professional provider direction remains the best-in-class Broker Workspace. SLICE-0053 provides its accepted authentication/account/Organization/Membership/role/MFA access boundary. Auth0 remains authentication-only; HullQ PostgreSQL/domain state owns authorization truth.

SLICE-0060 now adds the first accepted professional inventory read surface: an authenticated Account with current authorized Organization access can inspect only that Organization's current NativeListings with factual lifecycle, current offer, freshness and actual public-link state. The surface is read-only, bounded/keyset-paginated, private/no-store/noindex, and reuses existing FastAPI/domain/persistence truth rather than creating a second inventory model.

SLICE-0054 now adds the first accepted owner-direct provider surface:

```text
authenticated ordinary HullQ Account
→ private OwnerDirectListingDraft
→ create / list / reopen / update own drafts
→ incomplete pre-market state may persist
→ NOT PUBLIC
```

An owner-direct Account does not require a professional Organization or Membership. Ownership is derived from the authenticated session/account, not client input. Foreign/unknown draft access is non-enumerating, updates use optimistic versioning, login-next is bounded to the owner-direct surface, mutating browser requests use the accepted Origin + non-simple-header CSRF boundary, and private pages remain no-store/noindex.

## Hard truth and identity boundaries

Accepted marketplace identity remains:

```text
BoatDesignRef != PhysicalBoatId != MarketEpisodeId != NativeListingId != ExternalMarketObservationId
```

Hard truth rule remains:

```text
DESIGN / CONFIGURATION TRUTH != PHYSICAL BOAT / LISTING TRUTH
```

SLICE-0054 adds a separate pre-market identity:

```text
OwnerDirectListingDraftId
!= NativeListingId
!= PhysicalBoatId
!= MarketEpisodeId
```

Draft persistence is not marketplace truth. The accepted retained proof establishes that owner-direct draft operations do not create or mutate `physical_boats`, `market_episodes`, `native_listings`, NativeListing offer revision/head state, publication-transition state or freshness-confirmation state. No public Search promotion occurs.

## Owner-direct trust direction

Future normal publication baseline remains intentionally low-friction:

```text
HullQ account
+ verified phone reachability
+ explicit right-to-list attestation
+ baseline anti-abuse checks
```

Trust scopes remain separate:

```text
PHONE VERIFIED
IDENTITY VERIFIED
RIGHT-TO-LIST ATTESTED
SALE AUTHORITY VERIFIED
```

None promotes yacht technical fields. Strong identity/documentary sale-authority verification remains a separate future trust layer and should minimize HullQ retention of raw ID/selfie/biometric material.

SLICE-0054 implements none of publication/admission, phone verification, right-to-list attestation, identity verification, Sale Authority Verification, representation-conflict handling, media, enquiries/leads, broker referral, sale outcome, Search eligibility/ranking, delete/archive, payments or production pilot.

## Accepted technical Search result

HullQ now has exactly two accepted/closed public hard technical native-inventory Search criteria:

```text
1 — draft_max=<exact positive decimal metres>
2 — keel_configuration=<canonical v0.1 value>
```

Accepted public `keel_configuration` values are exactly `FIN`, `FIN_WITH_BULB`, `WING`, `CENTERBOARD`, `LIFTING_KEEL` and `TWIN_KEEL`.

The two criteria may be evaluated alone or together as deterministic hard MUST/AND requirements. SLICE-0055 preserves typed criterion/configuration evidence for confirmed match, confirmed non-match and insufficient-data application outcomes while keeping BoatDesign/configuration truth separate from concrete PhysicalBoat/listing truth.

The accepted technical native Search criteria count remains `2`. SLICE-0057 adds no criterion: it re-evaluates one buyer-selected replacement value for an already active accepted criterion through the same Search truth, in one coherent comparison snapshot, and exposes only factual set-difference counts plus the backend-owned canonical alternative Search path. SLICE-0058 likewise adds no Search criterion: it records explicit buyer interest locally by stable `NativeListingId` and re-resolves current public listing truth when viewed. SLICE-0059 adds no Search criterion: it uses that existing explicit Shortlist as the whole Compare set and re-resolves current public listing/PhysicalBoat claim truth into a factual side-by-side matrix without score, winner, recommendation or hidden weighting. SLICE-0060 also adds no Search criterion: it is a private professional Organization inventory projection over accepted NativeListing truth. Any future criterion #3+ readiness is subject to the accepted third-copy abstraction guard in `docs/governance/POST_0051_TRIGGER_GATES.md`.

## Post-SLICE-0051 trigger gates

Canonical records remain `docs/governance/POST_0051_TRIGGER_GATES.md`, `docs/governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md` and `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE.md`.

```text
POST_0051_ARCHITECTURE_RECONCILIATION: PASS
TECHNICAL_NATIVE_SEARCH_CRITERIA_COUNT: 2
WORKFLOW_REASSESSMENT_DUE_AFTER_SLICE: 0056
WORKFLOW_REASSESSMENT_STATUS: PASS

PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE_STATUS: NOT_TRIGGERED
EXTERNAL_BROKER_PRODUCTION_DATA_STATUS: NOT_PRESENT
EXTERNAL_OWNER_DIRECT_PRODUCTION_DATA_STATUS: NOT_PRESENT
PRODUCTION_PILOT_STATUS: NOT_STARTED
PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_STATUS: NOT_STARTED

BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE_STATUS: NOT_READY
BROKER_SELF_SERVICE_PILOT_STATUS: NOT_STARTED
PAID_BROKER_PLAN_STATUS: NOT_STARTED
```

SLICE-0060 used internal/synthetic retained proof and introduced no real external marketplace production data, broker self-service pilot, production pilot or public production launch. The Production Readiness gate therefore remains untriggered after acceptance. The mandatory post-0056 workflow reassessment remains `PASS`; SLICE-0060 acceptance does not alter that gate. Before real external marketplace inventory is exposed to external buyers, the accepted PostgreSQL HA/production-readiness rules remain mandatory.

## Broker Mandatory Capability Register

```text
BROKER_WORKSPACE_MANDATORY_COMMITMENTS_STATUS: OPEN
BROKER_WORKSPACE_PRODUCT_COMPLETION_STATUS: OPEN
BROKER_SALE_OUTCOME_WORKFLOW_STATUS: PENDING
SCALED_BROKER_ONBOARDING_STATUS: NOT_STARTED
SUFFICIENT_SEARCH_VOLUME_FOR_BROKER_INSIGHTS_STATUS: NOT_REACHED
POST_PILOT_REAL_BROKER_VALIDATION_STATUS: NOT_STARTED

REQ_BROKER_022_STATUS: PENDING

REQ_BROKER_027_STATUS: PENDING
REQ_BROKER_028_STATUS: PENDING
REQ_BROKER_029_STATUS: PENDING
REQ_BROKER_030_STATUS: IMPLEMENTED
```

SLICE-0060 changes none of these statuses and waives no professional-product obligation. It adds foundational Organization inventory visibility only; REQ-BROKER-023 branding and REQ-BROKER-024 connectivity-resilient draft recovery remain PENDING, and the Broker Workspace Launch Gate remains NOT_READY.

## Architecture and production direction

Current accepted application direction remains Astro as primary web framework with React only for justified interactive islands, FastAPI as sole application/domain API boundary, PostgreSQL 18 production target in DigitalOcean FRA1, Auth0 Public Cloud EU as authentication-only, and immutable container deployment through GHCR/versioned Docker Compose. Production app hosts remain stateless/replaceable; independent encrypted backup plus restore testing remains required.

The SLICE-0053 same-host session-topology invariant remains in force for browser-visible FastAPI auth/callback and authenticated Astro workspace surfaces. SLICE-0054 reuses this session boundary rather than creating a second authentication stack.

## Post-0054 buyer/seller reconciliation

`docs/POST_0054_BUYER_SELLER_PRODUCT_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-17.md` records the accepted optional Buyer Requirements/Decision Tools direction and shared Seller Platform direction. Direct Search remains primary; Buyer Requirements remain optional; `UNKNOWN != NOT_SATISFIED`; no match scores/winners/hidden weights are authorized. SLICE-0058 implements the bounded anonymous/local form of one ordinary personal Shortlist, and SLICE-0059 adds a factual whole-Shortlist Compare over current public truth while preserving the invariant that shortlist membership is buyer interest rather than HullQ fit.

## What remains unbuilt

Important future work includes owner-direct marketplace admission/publication and trust escalation; representation-conflict handling; seller-choice/broker referral; broker inventory create/edit workflow, branding/media and resilient drafts; leads/CRM/outcomes/analytics; export/bulk onboarding; buyer-facing Search explainability beyond the accepted one-change sensitivity capability; BuyerRequirements persistence; persistent/account Shortlist continuity and anonymous-to-account migration; sharing and persisted Compare subset/reorder; Rare Match and comparable-vessel semantics; Saved Search/alerts/price history; independent vessel-claim verification; production operations; broader SEO; payment/subscription enforcement; and any future transaction/escrow integration.

SLICE-0060 is owner-accepted and merged. Post-SLICE-0060 repository/product reconciliation selects SLICE-0061 Authenticated Professional Listing Draft Workspace as the next bounded capability. No implementation is authorized until its readiness package is independently accepted and merged.

## Next capability selection

Next queue number:

```text
SLICE-0061
```

**Selected capability:** Authenticated Professional Listing Draft Workspace.

Selection record: `docs/POST_SLICE_0060_REASSESSMENT_2026-09-20.md`.

Readiness artifact: `docs/slices/SLICE-0061-authenticated-professional-listing-draft-workspace.md`.

Normative bounded contract: `specs/PROFESSIONAL_LISTING_WORKSPACE_CONTRACT.v0.1.md`.

The capability lets a currently workspace-authorized Account whose exact current ACTIVE OrganizationMembership contains `PUBLISHER` create, list, reopen, read and update private incomplete professional listing drafts owned by one explicit Organization, with optimistic concurrency and no creation of PhysicalBoat/MarketEpisode/NativeListing/public Search truth. Public NativeListing publishing eligibility remains a separate later promotion/publication gate.

Implementation remains unauthorized until the readiness package passes independent exact-head review/CI and is merged to canonical `main`; only then may the Project Owner run `START_SLICE.bat`.

## Development workflow

- `origin/main` is canonical shared truth;
- one implementation slice per isolated worktree/branch;
- readiness/specification is independently reviewed and merged before implementation start;
- Project Owner runs `START_SLICE.bat` only after readiness is accepted;
- Claude Code implements; independent reviewer verifies exact implementation HEAD;
- material finding → amendment on the same branch;
- clean exact-head review → ACCEPT;
- explicit Project Owner acceptance is mandatory before implementation merge;
- acceptance closure follows implementation merge and advances `PROJECT_STATE_ACCEPTED_SLICE` atomically;
- `FINISH_SLICE.bat` closes the local slice only after remote closure is independently reviewed and merged;
- the next slice begins only after reassessment/readiness and uses a fresh Claude conversation;
- the mandatory post-SLICE-0056 workflow reassessment remains complete and `PASS`; SLICE-0061 Authenticated Professional Listing Draft Workspace is selected/readied but may not start until independent readiness review/CI and readiness merge are complete.

For exact hashes, amendments, gate runs and review history, read the corresponding acceptance closure rather than expanding this file into a second historical log.
