# HullQ Slice Index

**Status:** ACTIVE navigation board  
**Updated:** 2026-09-26  
**Canonical current-state authority:** `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

This file is deliberately a **compact navigation index**, not a second historical status authority.

The previous version had drifted to SLICE-0028 while the canonical project had already advanced through SLICE-0065. To prevent that class of contradiction from recurring:

- current accepted/queue state is read from `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`;
- final historical acceptance state is read from each slice's acceptance closure / later explicit Owner acceptance record;
- detailed slice history stays in the individual slice documents and Git history;
- this index tracks only the current execution boundary and key navigation ranges.

## Current execution boundary

```text
Latest owner-accepted slice: SLICE-0065
Current queue:               SLICE-0066
Current capability:          Required-Response / Assertion Input Alignment
```

Current slice:

- `docs/slices/SLICE-0066-required-response-assertion-input-alignment.md`
- read that primary slice for its live handoff status;
- read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` for the canonical accepted/queue boundary;
- no later slice is authorized automatically.

## Historical execution ranges

| Range | Operational meaning |
|---|---|
| SLICE-0001–0038 | accepted foundational research/architecture/data/product work except where an individual slice record states otherwise |
| SLICE-0039 | terminal historical `BLOCKED` exception; do not reopen |
| SLICE-0040–0065 | later accepted marketplace/Search/buyer/broker work; final state is authoritative in each acceptance closure and `PROJECT_STATE.md` |
| SLICE-0066 | current queue slice; live status is authoritative in its primary slice document |

Do not infer that every numeric slice in a range has identical type or historical handoff status. Use the individual slice file / acceptance closure when exact history matters.

## Current product execution focus

Current execution priority after the already-selected SLICE-0066 is governed by:

- `docs/BROKER_LAUNCH_EXECUTION_FOCUS_2026-09-26.md`
- `docs/PROFESSIONAL_MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_DECISIONS_2026-09-26.md`
- `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE.md`
- `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_MANDATORY_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md`
- `docs/PRODUCT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

The priority is to turn the accepted foundation into a coherent professional loop:

```text
broker creates
→ adds media
→ publishes
→ buyer contacts
→ broker handles lead
→ broker edits/maintains inventory
→ explicit outcome / scale capabilities as required by gates
```

No future slice number or exact scope is preassigned by this index.

## Navigation

- Current project state: `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Current execution focus: `docs/BROKER_LAUNCH_EXECUTION_FOCUS_2026-09-26.md`
- Product execution policy: `docs/PRODUCT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- Professional marketplace decisions: `docs/PROFESSIONAL_MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_DECISIONS_2026-09-26.md`
- AI slice workflow: `docs/engineering/AI_SLICE_WORKFLOW.md`
- Slice template: `docs/slices/SLICE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Broker launch gate: `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE.md`
- Mandatory broker capability register: `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_MANDATORY_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md`

## Maintenance rule

When a slice acceptance closure advances `PROJECT_STATE_ACCEPTED_SLICE` or a reassessment selects a new queue capability, update only this compact boundary section if needed. Do not mirror transient READY/REVIEW/BLOCKED handoff state here.

Do **not** rebuild a duplicated full historical ledger here. The old detailed ledger model is what allowed this file to become dozens of slices stale.

No later slice starts automatically.
