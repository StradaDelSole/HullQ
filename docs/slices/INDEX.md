# HullQ Slice Index

**Status:** ACTIVE navigation board  
**Updated:** 2026-10-12  
**Canonical current-state authority:** `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

This file is deliberately a **compact navigation index**, not a second historical status authority.

The previous version had drifted to SLICE-0028 while the canonical project had already advanced through SLICE-0065. To prevent that class of contradiction from recurring:

- current accepted/queue state is read from `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`;
- final historical acceptance state is read from each slice's acceptance closure / later explicit Owner acceptance record;
- detailed slice history stays in the individual slice documents and Git history;
- this index tracks only the current execution boundary and key navigation ranges.

## Current execution boundary

```text
Latest owner-accepted slice: SLICE-0081
Current queue:               SLICE-0082
Current capability:          Broker Listing → Canonical BoatDesign Association
Current readiness:           READY contract, review/CI/merge pending; implementation not started
```

Current boundary:

- SLICE-0081 is Owner-accepted; final implementation/review history is retained in `docs/slices/SLICE-0081-acceptance-closure.md`;
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` remains the canonical accepted/queue boundary;
- Production Launch Pack phase remains `NOT_STARTED`;
- post-SLICE-0080 reassessment selected Production Launch Pack Phase 1 for the limited pilot, but the Owner explicitly reprioritized unfinished product development on 2026-10-12;
- SLICE-0081 Operational Dashboard is merged and accepted; Phase-1 operator provisioning is paused in priority, not completed;
- SLICE-0082 is selected after the 2026-10-12 post-0081 source-to-Search review; the READY contract `SLICE-0082-broker-listing-boatdesign-association.md` and reassessment require independent review/CI/merge before `START_SLICE.bat`;
- no later slice is authorized automatically.

## Historical execution ranges

| Range | Operational meaning |
|---|---|
| SLICE-0001–0038 | accepted foundational research/architecture/data/product work except where an individual slice record states otherwise |
| SLICE-0039 | terminal historical `BLOCKED` exception; do not reopen |
| SLICE-0040–0081 | accepted marketplace/Search/buyer/broker/security/production-foundation/media-durability work; final state is authoritative in each acceptance closure and `PROJECT_STATE.md` |
| SLICE-0082 | selected broker NativeListing→canonical BoatDesign association; READY contract pending independent review/CI/merge; no implementation started |

Do not infer that every numeric slice in a range has identical type or historical handoff status. Use the individual slice file / acceptance closure when exact history matters.

## Current product execution focus

Current execution priority after accepted SLICE-0079 is governed by:

- `docs/BROKER_LAUNCH_EXECUTION_FOCUS_2026-09-26.md`
- `docs/PROFESSIONAL_MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_DECISIONS_2026-09-26.md`
- `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE.md`
- `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_MANDATORY_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md`
- `docs/PRODUCT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

The priority is to turn the accepted foundation into a coherent professional loop:

```text
broker creates
→ adds media
→ publishes
→ buyer contacts
→ broker handles lead
→ broker edits/maintains inventory
→ explicit outcome / scale capabilities as required by gates
```

No future slice number or exact scope is preassigned by this index.

## Navigation

- Current project state: `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Current execution focus: `docs/BROKER_LAUNCH_EXECUTION_FOCUS_2026-09-26.md`
- Product execution policy: `docs/PRODUCT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- Professional marketplace decisions: `docs/PROFESSIONAL_MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_DECISIONS_2026-09-26.md`
- AI slice workflow: `docs/engineering/AI_SLICE_WORKFLOW.md`
- Slice template: `docs/slices/SLICE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Broker launch gate: `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_LAUNCH_GATE.md`
- Mandatory broker capability register: `docs/governance/BROKER_WORKSPACE_MANDATORY_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md`

## Maintenance rule

When a slice acceptance closure advances `PROJECT_STATE_ACCEPTED_SLICE` or a reassessment selects a new queue capability, update only this compact boundary section if needed. Do not mirror transient READY/REVIEW/BLOCKED handoff state here.

Do **not** rebuild a duplicated full historical ledger here. The old detailed ledger model is what allowed this file to become dozens of slices stale.

No later slice starts automatically.
